Welcome to the Sample Agents repository! This collection provides ready-to-use agents built on top of the [Agent Development Kit](https://github.com/google/adk-python), designed to accelerate your development process. These agents cover a range of common use cases and complexities, from simple conversational bots to complex multi-agent workflows.

## ‚ú® What are Sample Agents?

A Sample Agent is a functional starting point for a foundational agent designed for common application scenarios. It comes pre-packaged with core logic (like different agents using different tools, evaluation, human in the loop) relevant to a specific use case or industry. While functional, a Sample Agent typically requires customization (e.g., adjusting specific responses or integrating with external systems) to be fully operational. Each agent includes instructions on how it can be customized.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the sample agents:

1.  **Prerequisites:**

    - **Install the ADK Samples:** Ensure you have the Agent Development Kit installed and configured. Follow the [ADK Installation Guide](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/get-started/installation/).
    - **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT - Configuration Setup:** This project requires sensitive API keys and credentials to function. **DO NOT commit these secrets to version control.**
      - üìñ **Read the [CONFIG_INSTRUCTIONS.md](CONFIG_INSTRUCTIONS.md) file first** for detailed setup instructions
      - You will need to create `.env` files and configuration files from the provided templates
      - All required environment variables, API keys, and configuration options are documented in the configuration instructions
    - **Google Cloud Project (Recommended):** While some agents might run locally with just an API key, most leverage Google Cloud services like Vertex AI and BigQuery. A configured Google Cloud project is highly recommended. See the [ADK Quickstart](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/get-started/quickstart/) for setup details.

2.  **‚ö†Ô∏è BEFORE RUNNING: Complete Configuration Setup**
    Follow the instructions in [CONFIG_INSTRUCTIONS.md](CONFIG_INSTRUCTIONS.md) to:

    - Set up your API keys and credentials
    - Create the required `.env` files
    - Configure frontend settings

3.  **Clone this repository:**
    You can install the ADK samples via cloning it from the public repository by
    `bash
    git clone https://github.com/google/adk-samples.git
    cd adk-samples
    `

4.  **Explore the Agents:**

- Navigate to the `agents/` directory.
- The `agents/README.md` provides an overview and categorization of the available agents.
- Browse the subdirectories. Each contains a specific sample agent with its own `README.md`.

4.  **Run an Agent:**

    - Choose an agent from the `agents/` directory.
    - Navigate into that agent's specific directory (e.g., `cd agents/llm-auditor`).
    - Follow the instructions in _that agent's_ `README.md` file for specific setup (like installing dependencies via `poetry install`) and running the agent.

    Browse the folders in this repository. Each agent and tool have its own `README.md` file with detailed instructions.

**Notes:**

- These agents have been built and tested using [Google models](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/models) on Vertex AI. You can test these samples with other models as well. Please refer to [ADK Tutorials](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/models/) to use other models for these samples.
